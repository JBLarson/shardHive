# shardHive

Formerly private repository for a defunct project.

shardHive was a decentralized file storage solution that divided files into chunks, encrypted the chunks using a users private key that's stored on a RFID tag, distributed chunks to various raspberry pi file servers, with RFID authentication by a user, the system would retrieve encrypted shards from the testnet of Raspberry Pi's, decrypted the shards, and reassemble the files.

It was an inefficient and convaluted endevaor where I accomplished little, but learnt a lot.

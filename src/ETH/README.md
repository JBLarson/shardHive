### ETH Private Key Sharding and Distribution System
# First Stable Build

<b>theUserId</b> is a variable used in every other program. It is set in the (shardFuncs.py) [shardFuncs.py] function library for now.


May combine sftpRead and processShards to prevent unencypted shards from being accessed if sftpRead executes without processShards also being run.
